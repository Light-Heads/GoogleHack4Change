Prune leaves, stems and other infested parts of plants well past any webbing and discard in trash (and not in compost piles). Don’t be hesitant to pull entire plants to prevent the mites spreading to its neighbors.
Use the Bug Blaster to wash plants with a strong stream of water and reduce pest numbers.
Commercially available beneficial insects, such as ladybugs, lacewing and predatory mites are important natural enemies. For best results, make releases when pest levels are low to medium.
Dust on leaves, branches and fruit encourages mites. A mid-season hosing (or two!) to remove dust from trees is a worthwhile preventative.
Insecticidal soap or botanical insecticides can be used to spot treat heavily infested areas.
"""
Tomato__Target_Spot = """
1. Remove old plant debris at the end of the growing season; otherwise, the spores will travel from debris to newly planted tomatoes in the following growing fc, thus beginning the disease anew. Dispose of the debris properly and don’t place it on your compost pile unless you’re sure your compost gets hot enough to kill the spores.

2. Rotate crops and don’t plant tomatoes in areas where other disease-prone plants have been located in the past year – primarily eggplant, peppers, potatoes or, of course – tomatoes. Rutgers University Extension recommends a three-year rotation cycle to reduce soil-borne fungi.

3. Pay careful attention to air circulation, as target spot of tomato thrives in humid conditions. Grow the plants in full sunlight. Be sure the plants aren’t crowded and that each tomato has plenty of air circulation. Cage or stake tomato plants to keep the plants above the soil.

4. Water tomato plants in the morning so the leaves have time to dry. Water at the base of the plant or use a soaker hose or drip system to keep the leaves dry. Apply a mulch to keep the fruit from coming in direct contact with the soil. Limit to mulch to 3 inches or less if your plants are bothered by slugs or snails.

5. You can also apply fungal spray as a preventive measure early in the season, or as soon as the disease is noticed.

Do not save seed from infected crops.

Cover plants with floating row covers of fine mesh (Agryl or Agribon) to protect from whitefly infestations.
Practice good weed management in and around fields to the extent feasible.
